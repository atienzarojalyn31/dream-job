Hi Anne,

Thank you for reaching out to us about our Summer Interview Prep course. We understand how disappointing it must be to miss the deadline, especially with your graduation approaching soon.

We are sorry to hear about the challenges youâ€™ve faced in securing an internship despite your extensive efforts. It is clear that you are committed to advancing your career, and we appreciate your interest in our program.

While our current course is at full capacity with a long waitlist, we would like to support you in your preparation for future opportunities. Allow me to share our [high-level software interview guide](https://hackmd.io/@nesquena/HJN9k17sm?type=view), which contains valuable tips and insights that could be beneficial as you continue to pursue your career goals.

Additionally, please visit our resources page where you can find more information about our offerings and other useful content. You are also welcome to sign up for our [mailing list](https://share.hsforms.com/1eg_EOoQpR4ObU4s8fUES2Q36gst) to stay informed about upcoming courses and virtual events that may align with your interests.
