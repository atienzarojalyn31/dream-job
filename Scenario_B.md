Dear Jane,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your enthusiasm for our program. We truly appreciate the effort and dedication you out into developing your Flix app during the application process.

We understand your disappointment regarding the criteria. We strive to be transparent about the requirements through multiple checkpoints on our application platform, though we acknowledge that sometimes details may not be fully absorbed during the application process.

Currently, **our courses are limited to students enrolled in our partner universities within the United States due to our current sponsorships and operational agreements**. While we admire your passion for learning and your frequent visits to the US, we are unable to make exceptions to our eligibility requirements at this time.

We value your interest and would encourage you to keep an eye on our future expansions and program updates. We are continuously exploring opportunities to broaden our reach and may expand to other countries in the future.

We apologize for any frustrations this may have caused and want to assure you that your efforts have not gone unnoticed. Should you have any further questions or would like guidance on alternative learning resources, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Thank you once again for considering CodePath.

All the best,

CodePath.org Team
