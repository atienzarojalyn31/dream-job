Dear John,

Thank you for reaching out and expressing your interest in joining the Advanced track for our Web Development program. We appreciate your enthusiasm and understand your desire to challenge yourself. 

Our placement decision is primarily based on your submitted pre-work score and through this assessment we can ensure that each student is placed in a track that aligns with their current skill level and provides the best learning experience possible.

While we acknowledge your academic achievement at MIT, our priority is to maintain a curriculum structure that supports the progression and success of all students. I acknowledge that as per the course overview links below, some topics are similar to both tracks but the pacing depends greatly on the level of the course.

-[Intermediate track](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/web102/syllabus)
-[Advanced track](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/web103/syllabus)

We encourage you to continue in the Intermediate track, where you can solidify your skills and prepare thoroughly for more advanced concepts. 

If you have any further questions or would like to discuss further, please feel free to reach out. Weâ€™re here to support you in your learning journey.

All the best,
CodePath.org Team
