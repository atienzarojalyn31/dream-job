Hi Dennis,

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding your request to be reinstated in the CYB101 (Intro to Cybersecurity) course.

We regret to inform you that, as per our [course policies](https://courses.codepath.org/snippets/ios_university/policies_remote_fall19), students who have missed to submit coursework requirements within the provided deadline and extension of such are subject to withdrawal from the class. Despite our previous attempts to contact you via email and Slack for an explanation, we did not receive a response from you.

Therefore, we are unable to reconsider your enrollment in the course at this time. We encourage you to review the course material provided in Github repository associated with your account, as you will retain lifetime access to it.

Should you have any further questions or require assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out.

All the best,

CodePath.org Team
